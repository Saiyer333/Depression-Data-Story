This project provides a comprehensive data story on depression, exploring its prevalence, symptoms, causes, impact, and the latest research. 
The data story was initially developed as a presentation and later transformed into an article published on Medium. 
The project leverages Python for data analysis and visualization, with the resulting charts used to support the insights shared in the article.
